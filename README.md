Brill√© is a personal web project made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a college assignment. Its goal was to practice logic and JavaScript while creating a clean, elegant, and interactive interface to apply front-end development concepts in a practical way and showcase my learning. To use this project, simply clone the repository with git clone and open the index.html file in your browser. You can use it as a reference to study HTML structure, CSS layout, and basic JavaScript interactivity. Feel free to modify the HTML files to change the content, edit style.css for design adjustments, or update script.js to implement new features and improve your skills. This project is open source under the MIT License and was created as part of my front-end learning journey in college.
